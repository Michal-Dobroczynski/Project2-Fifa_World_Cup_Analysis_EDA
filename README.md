## Introduction of Fifa World Cup: 

The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. 

It is contested every four years and is the most prestigious and important trophy in the sport of football, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions. </br>
